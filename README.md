### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Study-Buddy-2.0.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Study-Buddy-2.0
    ```

3. **Run the Makefile** to compile the C code:
    - If you're on Windows, use MinGW to run the following:
      ```bash
      mingw32-make
      ```

      make
      ```

4. **Access the webapp** by opening your browser and going to `http://localhost:8080`.

## Makefile Explanation

The Makefile used in this project automates the build process. It compiles the C code and starts the project in one go.

```makefile
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -O2 -mconsole
TARGET = study_buddy

all: $(TARGET)

$(TARGET): study_buddy.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $(TARGET) study_buddy.c -lws2_32

clean:
	rm -f $(TARGET).exe
````

### Key Makefile Steps:

* **CC**: Specifies the compiler (`gcc` for C).
* **CFLAGS**: Compiler flags (`-Wall` for warnings, `-O2` for optimization, `-mconsole` for Windows console).
* **TARGET**: The output executable (`study_buddy`).
* **all**: Default target that builds the project by compiling `study_buddy.c`.
* **clean**: Removes the executable file.
